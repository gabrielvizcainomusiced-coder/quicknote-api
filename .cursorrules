You are working on the QuickNote API backend built with Node.js and Express.

## Project Context
- REST API for a note-taking application
- Uses PostgreSQL for data persistence
- Follows test-driven development practices
- All database queries use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

## Coding Standards
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Always write tests BEFORE implementation (TDD)
- Follow RESTful conventions
- Use proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500)
- Validate all user inputs
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Never commit .env files

## Testing Requirements
- Every controller function must have unit tests
- Every route must have integration tests
- Test coverage should be above 70%
- Run tests with: npm test
- Run tests in watch mode: npm run test:watch

## Database
- Use parameterized queries ($1, $2, etc.) to prevent SQL injection
- Always handle database errors gracefully
- Close database connections properly
- Use transactions for multi-step operations

## API Design
- All endpoints start with /api
- POST /api/notes - Create note
- GET /api/notes - Get all notes
- GET /api/notes/:id - Get single note
- PUT /api/notes/:id - Update note
- DELETE /api/notes/:id - Delete note

## When generating code:
1. Write the test first (TDD approach)
2. Run the test to see it fail
3. Write minimal code to make it pass
4. Refactor if needed
5. Ensure test coverage remains above 70%
